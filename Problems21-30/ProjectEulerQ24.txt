This question can be solved simply with Math. Starting with 0 in position 0 we have 362,880 ways (9!) to  order the other nine digits. Then if we multiply this value by three we have a value of 1,088,640 so this means we have a starting number of number of 2, since a starting value of three would exceed our target. So guesssing 20________ starts at permutation 725,760. Then we can permuate the next 8 numbers  40320 ways. If we multiply by 7 we go over target, so we now know 2 numbers 27. Then we say 7! is 5040 and we find that 7 puts us over, so 278. Then 6! is 720 which goes over at 3 times. So 2783. Then 5! is 120 and we go over at 6. So 27839. Then 4! is 24. We go over at 2 times so 278391. Then 3! is 6 and we go over at 3 so 2783915. Then 2! is 2 and 2 would put us over so 27839154. Then both 1! and 0! are 1 so we choose 6 then 0. 2783915460
